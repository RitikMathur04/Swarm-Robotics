## Master-Slave Communication and Synchronization with Line-Follower
<br>
Master-Slave synchronization of two bots using NRF24L01 transceiver module in which slave bot coordinates the automated visual line-following master bot. The objective is to establish wireless communication between the two bots to disseminate mechanical work and control chaos in a mechanical system.<br>
This project has been implemented as a part of Srishti-2019, Artificial Intelligence and Electronics Society (ARIES), IIT Roorkee. Srishti is the Annual Technical Exhibition of IIT Roorkee that aims towards integrating all realms of technical activities conducted within the R-land. Since its inception in 1958, Srishti has inspired the brilliant minds of our institute to come up with creative ideas and practical innovations.  <br>
The project is implemented using open-source Arduino Software IDE which makes it easy to write code and upload it to the board.
